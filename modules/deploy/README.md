# Lambda Function Deployment via AWS CodeDeploy

Terraform module, which creates Lambda alias as well as AWS CodeDeploy resources  required to deploy.

This Terraform module is the part of [serverless.tf framework](https://github.com/antonbabenko/serverless.tf), which aims to simplify all operations when working with the serverless in Terraform.

This module can create AWS CodeDeploy application and deployment group, if necessary. If you have several functions, you probably want to create those resources externally, and then set `use_existing_deployment_group = true`.

During deployment this module does the following:
1. Create JSON object with required AppSpec configuration. Optionally, you can store deploy script for debug purposes by setting `save_deploy_script = true`.
1. Run [`aws deploy create-deployment` command](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/deploy/create-deployment.html) if `create_deployment = true` was set
1. After deployment is created, it can wait for the completion if `wait_deployment_completion = true`. Be aware, that Terraform will lock the execution and it can fail if it runs for a long period of time. Set this flag for fast deployments (eg, `deployment_config_name = "CodeDeployDefault.LambdaAllAtOnce"`).


## Usage

### Complete example of Lambda Function deployment via AWS CodeDeploy

```hcl
module "lambda_function" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-lambda1"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  source_path = "../src/lambda-function1"
}

module "alias_refresh" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws//modules/alias"

  name          = "current-with-refresh"
  function_name = module.lambda_function.this_lambda_function_name

  # Set function_version when creating alias to be able to deploy using it,
  # because AWS CodeDeploy doesn't understand $LATEST as CurrentVersion.
  function_version = module.lambda_function.this_lambda_function_version
}

module "deploy" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws//modules/deploy"

  alias_name    = module.alias_refresh.this_lambda_alias_name
  function_name = module.lambda_function.this_lambda_function_name

  target_version = module.lambda_function.this_lambda_function_version

  create_app = true
  app_name   = "my-awesome-app"

  create_deployment_group = true
  deployment_group_name   = "something"

  create_deployment          = true
  wait_deployment_completion = true

  triggers = {
    start = {
      events     = ["DeploymentStart"]
      name       = "DeploymentStart"
      target_arn = "arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:135367859851:sns1"
    }
    success = {
      events     = ["DeploymentSuccess"]
      name       = "DeploymentSuccess"
      target_arn = "arn:aws:sns:eu-west-1:135367859851:sns2"
    }
  }
}
```

## Conditional creation

Sometimes you need to have a way to create resources conditionally but Terraform does not allow usage of `count` inside `module` block, so the solution is to specify `create` arguments.

```hcl
module "lambda" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws//modules/deploy"

  create = false # to disable all resources

  create_app                    = false
  use_existing_app              = false
  create_deployment_group       = false
  use_existing_deployment_group = false

  # ... omitted
}
```
