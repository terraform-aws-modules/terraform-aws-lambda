# AWS Lambda Terraform module

Terraform module, which creates almost all supported AWS Lambda resources as well as taking care of building and packaging of required Lambda dependencies for functions and layers.

These types of resources supported:

* [Lambda Function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_function.html)
* [Lambda Layer](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_layer_version.html)
* [Lambda Alias](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_alias.html) - using [alias module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/modules/alias)
* [Lambda Provisioned Concurrency](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_provisioned_concurrency_config.html)
* [Lambda Async Event Configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_function_event_invoke_config.html)
* [Lambda Permission](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_permission.html)

Not supported, yet:
* [Lambda Event Source Mapping](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/lambda_event_source_mapping.html)


This Terraform module is the part of [serverless.tf framework](https://github.com/antonbabenko/serverless.tf), which aims to simplify all operations when working with the serverless in Terraform:

1. Build and install dependencies - [read more](#build).
2. Create, store, and use deployment packages - [read more](#package).
3. Create, update, and publish AWS Lambda Function and Lambda Layer - [see usage](#usage).
4. Create static and dynamic aliases for AWS Lambda Function - [see usage](#usage), see [modules/alias](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/modules/alias).
5. Do complex deployments (eg, rolling, canary, rollbacks, triggers) - [read more](#deployment), see [modules/deploy](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/modules/deploy).

## Usage

### Lambda Function (store package locally)

```hcl
module "lambda_function" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-lambda1"
  description   = "My awesome lambda function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  source_path = "../src/lambda-function1"

  tags = {
    Name = "my-lambda1"
  }
}
```

### Lambda Function and Lambda Layer (store packages on S3)

```hcl
module "lambda_function" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "lambda-with-layer"
  description   = "My awesome lambda function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"
  publish       = true

  source_path = "../src/lambda-function1"

  store_on_s3 = true
  s3_bucket   = "my-bucket-with-lambda-builds"

  layers = [
    module.lambda_layer_s3.this_lambda_layer_arn,
  ]

  environment_variables = {
    Serverless = "Terraform"
  }

  tags = {
    Module = "lambda-with-layer"
  }
}

module "lambda_layer_s3" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  create_layer = true

  layer_name          = "lambda-layer-s3"
  description         = "My amazing lambda layer (deployed from S3)"
  compatible_runtimes = ["python3.8"]

  source_path = "../src/lambda-layer"

  store_on_s3 = true
  s3_bucket   = "my-bucket-with-lambda-builds"
}

```

### Lambda Functions with existing package (prebuilt) stored locally

```hcl
module "lambda_function_existing_package_local" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-lambda-existing-package-local"
  description   = "My awesome lambda function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  create_package         = false
  local_existing_package = "../existing_package.zip"
}
```

### Lambda Function with existing package (prebuilt) stored in S3 bucket

Note that this module does not copy prebuilt packages into S3 bucket. This module can only store packages it builds locally and in S3 bucket.

```hcl
locals {
  my_function_source = "../path/to/package.zip"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_object" "my_function" {
  bucket = "my-bucket-with-lambda-builds"
  key    = "${filemd5(local.my_function_source)}.zip"
  source = local.my_function_source
}

module "lambda_function_existing_package_s3" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-lambda-existing-package-local"
  description   = "My awesome lambda function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  create_package      = false
  s3_existing_package = {
    bucket = "my-bucket-with-lambda-builds"
    key    = aws_s3_bucket_object.my_function.id
  }
}
```

### Lambda Layers (store packages locally and on S3)

```hcl
module "lambda_layer_local" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  create_layer = true

  layer_name          = "my-layer-local"
  description         = "My amazing lambda layer (deployed from local)"
  compatible_runtimes = ["python3.8"]

  source_path = "../fixtures/python3.8-app1"
}

module "lambda_layer_s3" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  create_layer = true

  layer_name          = "my-layer-s3"
  description         = "My amazing lambda layer (deployed from S3)"
  compatible_runtimes = ["python3.8"]

  source_path = "../fixtures/python3.8-app1"

  store_on_s3 = true
  s3_bucket   = "my-bucket-with-lambda-builds"
}
```

### Lambda@Edge

Make sure, you deploy Lambda@Edge functions into US East (N. Virginia) region (`us-east-1`). See [Requirements and Restrictions on Lambda Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-requirements-limits.html#lambda-requirements-cloudfront-triggers).

```hcl
module "lambda_at_edge" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  lambda_at_edge = true

  function_name = "my-lambda-at-edge"
  description   = "My awesome lambda@edge function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  source_path = "../fixtures/python3.8-app1"

  tags = {
    Module = "lambda-at-edge"
  }
}
```

### Lambda Function in VPC

```hcl
module "lambda_function_in_vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-lambda-in-vpc"
  description   = "My awesome lambda function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  source_path = "../fixtures/python3.8-app1"

  vpc_subnet_ids         = module.vpc.intra_subnets
  vpc_security_group_ids = [module.vpc.default_security_group_id]
  attach_network_policy = true
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.10.0.0/16"

  # Specify at least one of: intra_subnets, private_subnets, or public_subnets
  azs           = ["eu-west-1a", "eu-west-1b", "eu-west-1c"]
  intra_subnets = ["10.10.101.0/24", "10.10.102.0/24", "10.10.103.0/24"]
}
```


## Additional IAM policies for Lambda Functions

There are 4 supported ways to attach IAM policies to IAM role used by Lambda Function:

1. `policy_json` - set as JSON string or heredoc, when `attach_policy_json = true`.
1. `policy` - ARN of existing IAM policy, when `attach_policy = true`.
1. `policies` - List of ARNs of existing IAM policies, when `attach_policies = true`.
1. `policy_statements` - Map of maps to define IAM statements which will be generated as IAM policy. Requires `attach_policy_statements = true`. See examples/complete for more information.


## Lambda Permissions for allowed triggers

Lambda Permissions should be specified to allow certain resources to invoke Lambda Function.
 
```hcl
module "lambda_function" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"
  
  # ...omitted for brevity

  allowed_triggers = {
    APIGatewayAny = {
      service = "apigateway"
      arn     = "arn:aws:execute-api:eu-west-1:135367859851:aqnku8akd0"
    },
    APIGatewayDevPost = {
      service    = "apigateway"
      source_arn = "arn:aws:execute-api:eu-west-1:135367859851:aqnku8akd0/dev/POST/*"
    },
    OneRule = {
      principal  = "events.amazonaws.com"
      source_arn = "arn:aws:events:eu-west-1:135367859851:rule/RunDaily"
    }
  }
}
```

Note: `service = "apigateway" with arn` is a short form to allow invocations of a Lambda Function from any stage, any method, any resource of an API Gateway.

## Conditional creation

Sometimes you need to have a way to create resources conditionally but Terraform does not allow usage of `count` inside `module` block, so the solution is to specify `create` arguments.

```hcl
module "lambda" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  create = false # to disable all resources

  create_package  = false  # to control build package process
  create_function = false  # to control creation of the Lambda Function and related resources
  create_layer    = false  # to control creation of the Lambda Layer and related resources
  create_role     = false  # to control creation of the IAM role and policies required for Lambda Function

  attach_cloudwatch_logs_policy = false
  attach_dead_letter_policy     = false
  attach_network_policy         = false
  attach_tracing_policy         = false
  attach_async_event_policy     = false

  # ... omitted
}
```

## <a name="build-package"></a> How does building and packaging work?

This is one of the most complicated part done by the module and normally you don't have to know internals.

`package.py` is Python script which does it. Make sure, Python 3.7 or newer is installed. The main functions of the script are to generate a filename of zip-archive based on the content of the files, verify if zip-archive has been already created, and create zip-archive only when it is necessary (during `apply`, not `plan`).

Hash of zip-archive created with the same content of the files is always identical which prevents unnecessary force-updates of the Lambda resources unless content modifies. If you need to have different filenames for the same content you can specify extra string argument `hash_extra`.

When calling this module multiple times in one execution to create packages with the same `source_path`, zip-archives will be corrupted due to concurrent writes into the same file. There are two solutions - set different values for `hash_extra` to create different archives, or create package once outside (using this module) and then pass `local_existing_package` argument to create other Lambda resources.

Building and packaging has been historically hard to debug (especially with Terraform), so we made an effort to make it easier for user to see debug info. There are 3 different debug levels: `DEBUG` - to see only what is happening during planning phase, `DEBUG2` - to see all logging values, `DEBUG3` - to see all logging values and env variables (be careful sharing your env variables as they may contain secrets!).

User can specify debug level like this:

```
export TF_LAMBDA_PACKAGE_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG2
terraform apply 
```

## <a name="build"></a> Build Dependencies

You can specify `source_path` in a variety of ways to achieve desired flexibility when building deployment packages locally or in Docker. You can use absolute or relative paths.

Note that, when building locally, files are not copying anywhere from the source directories when making packages, we use fast Python regular expressions to find matching files and directories, which makes packaging very fast and easy to understand.

### Simple build from single directory

When `source_path` is set to a string, the content of that path will be used to create deployment package as-is:

`source_path = "src/function1"`

### Static build from multiple source directories

When `source_path` is set to a list of directories the content of each will be taken and one archive will be created.


### Combine various options for extreme flexibility

This is the most complete way of creating a deployment package from multiple sources with multiple dependencies. This example is showing all the available options:

```hcl
source_path = [
  "src/main-source",
  {
    path     = "src/function1-dep",
    patterns = [
      "!.*/.*\\.txt", # Skip all txt files recursively
    ]
  }, {
    path             = "src/python3.8-app1",
    pip_requirements = true,
    prefix_in_zip    = "foo/bar1",
  }, {
    path             = "src/python3.8-app2",
    pip_requirements = "requirements-large.txt",
  }, {
    path     = "src/python3.8-app3",
    commands = ["npm install"],
    patterns = [
      "!.*/.*\\.txt",    # Skip all txt files recursively
      "node_modules/.+", # Include all node_modules
    ],
  }, {
    path     = "src/python3.8-app3",
    commands = ["go build"],
    patterns = <<END
      bin/.*
      abc/def/.*
    END
  }
]
```

Few notes:

* All arguments except `path` are optional.
* `patterns` - List of Python regex filenames should satisfy. Default value is "include everything" which is equal to `patterns = [".*"]`. This can also be specified as multiline heredoc string (no comments allowed). Some examples of valid patterns:

```txt
    !.*/.*\.txt        # Filter all txt files recursively
    node_modules/.*    # Include empty dir or with a content if it exists
    node_modules/.+    # Include full non empty node_modules dir with its content
    node_modules/      # Include node_modules itself without its content
                       # It's also a way to include an empty dir if it exists
    node_modules       # Include a file or an existing dir only

    !abc/.*            # Filter out everything in an abc folder
    abc/def/.*         # Re-include everything in abc/def sub folder
    !abc/def/hgk/.*    # Filter out again in abc/def/hgk sub folder
```

* `commands` - List of commands to run. If specified, this argument overrides `pip_requirements`.
* `pip_requirements` - Set to `true` to run `pip install` with `requirements.txt` found in `path`. Or set to another filename which you want to use instead.
* `prefix_in_zip` - If specified, will be used as a prefix inside zip-archive. By default, everything installs into the root of zip-archive.


### Building in Docker

If your Lambda Function or Layer uses some dependencies you can build them in Docker and have them included into deployment package. Here is how you can do it:

    build_in_docker   = true
    docker_file       = "src/python3.8-app1/docker/Dockerfile"
    docker_build_root = "src/python3.8-app1/docker"
    docker_image      = "lambci/lambda:build-python3.8"
    runtime           = "python3.8"    # Setting runtime is required when building package in Docker and Lambda Layer resource.

Using this module you can install dependencies from private hosts. To do this, you need for forward SSH agent:

    docker_with_ssh_agent = true


## <a name="package"></a> Deployment package - Create or use existing

By default, this module creates deployment package and uses it to create or update Lambda Function or Lambda Layer.

Sometimes, you may want to separate build of deployment package (eg, to compile and install dependencies) from the deployment of a package into two separate steps.

When creating archive locally outside of this module you need to set `create_package = false` and then argument `local_existing_package = "existing_package.zip"`. Alternatively, you may prefer to keep your deployment packages into S3 bucket and provide a reference to them like this:

```hcl
  create_package      = false
  s3_existing_package = {
    bucket = "my-bucket-with-lambda-builds"
    key    = "existing_package.zip"
  }
```

### Using deployment package from remote URL

This can be implemented in two steps: download file locally using CURL, and pass path to deployment package as `local_existing_package` argument.

```hcl
locals {
  package_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/master/examples/fixtures/python3.8-zip/existing_package.zip"
  downloaded  = "downloaded_package_${md5(local.package_url)}.zip"
}

resource "null_resource" "download_package" {
  triggers = {
    downloaded = local.downloaded
  }

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "curl -L -o ${local.downloaded} ${local.package_url}"
  }
}

data "null_data_source" "downloaded_package" {
  inputs = {
    id       = null_resource.download_package.id
    filename = local.downloaded
  }
}

module "lambda_function_existing_package_from_remote_url" {
  source = "terraform-aws-modules/lambda/aws"

  function_name = "my-lambda-existing-package-local"
  description   = "My awesome lambda function"
  handler       = "index.lambda_handler"
  runtime       = "python3.8"

  create_package         = false
  local_existing_package = data.null_data_source.downloaded_package.outputs["filename"]
}
```


## <a name="deployment"></a> How to deploy and manage Lambda Functions?

### Simple deployments

Typically, Lambda Function resource updates when source code changes. If `publish = true` is specified a new [Lambda Function version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-versions.html) will also be created.

Published Lambda Function can be invoked using either by version number or using `$LATEST`. This is the simplest way of deployment which does not required any additional tool or service.


### Controlled deployments (rolling, canary, rollbacks)

In order to do controlled deployments (rolling, canary, rollbacks) of Lambda Functions we need to use [Lambda Function aliases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-aliases.html).

In simple terms, Lambda alias is like a pointer to either one version of Lambda Function (when deployment complete), or to two weighted versions of Lambda Function (during rolling or canary deployment).

One Lambda Function can be used in multiple aliases. Using aliases gives large control of which version deployed when having multiple environments.

There is [alias module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/modules/alias), which simplifies working with alias (create, manage configurations, updates, etc). See [examples/alias](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/examples/alias) for various use-cases how aliases can be configured and used.

There is [deploy module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/modules/deploy), which creates required resources to do deployments using AWS CodeDeploy. It also creates the deployment, and wait for completion. See [examples/deploy](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda/tree/master/examples/deploy) for complete end-to-end build/update/deploy process.


## FAQ

Q1: Why deployment package not recreating every time I change something?

A1: There can be tons of reasons. The most likely is that changes has happened inside of dependency which is not used in calculating content hash. You can force it by setting value of `hash_extra` or to delete previously built package locally.

Q2: How to force recreate deployment package?

A2: Delete an existing zip-archive from `builds` directory, or make a change in your source code. If there is no zip-archive for the current content hash, it will be recreated during `terraform apply`.

Q3: `null_resource.archive[0] must be replaced`

A3: This probably mean that zip-archive has been deployed, but is currently absent locally, and it has to be recreated locally. When you run into this issue during CI/CD process (where workspace is clean), you can set environment variable `TF_RECREATE_MISSING_LAMBDA_PACKAGE=false` and run `terraform apply`.


## Notes

1. Creation of Lambda Functions and Lambda Layers is very similar and both support the same features (building from source path, using existing package, storing package locally or on S3)
2. Check out this [Awesome list of AWS Lambda Layers](https://github.com/mthenw/awesome-layers)
