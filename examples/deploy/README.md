# Do Lambda Function Deployments using AWS CodeDeploy

Configuration in this directory creates Lambda Function, Alias, and all resources required to create deployments using AWS CodeDeploy.

PS: This example and modules/deploy is a bit incomplete, because it creates a bit too much.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which cost money. Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
