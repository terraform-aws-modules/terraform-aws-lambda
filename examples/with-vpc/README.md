# AWS Lambda with VPC example

Configuration in this directory creates AWS Lambda Function deployed with VPC.

Be aware, that deletion of AWS Lambda with VPC can take long time (eg, 10 minutes).

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

Note that this example may create resources which cost money. Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
