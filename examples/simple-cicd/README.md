# Simple CI/CD example

Configuration in this directory creates AWS Lambda Function as it would run in a context of CICD executions, where the Terraform working directory is empty and there is no `builds` directory, that:

- `terraform plan` doesn't trigger a diff if the source code of the lambda function didn't change.
- `terraform plan` does trigger a diff if the source code of the lambda function has changed.
- `terraform apply` works if the code has changed.

## Usage

To run this example you need to execute:

```bash
./test.sh
```

Note that this example may create resources which cost money. Run `terraform destroy` when you don't need these resources.
